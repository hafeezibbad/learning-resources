Generally, [Real Python](https://realpython.com/) has pretty good tutorials, notes on Python related topics. 

For beginners, [30 days of Python](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python) gives a good starting point for learning to program with Python.
## Frameworks
* [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/): A easy to develop, high-performance web framework for building APIs, with support for type-hinting, automatic documentation generation. [Here](https://github.com/mjhea0/awesome-fastapi) is a list of libraries related to FastAPI and [some projects](https://github.com/Kludex/awesome-fastapi-projects) build using FastAPI.

### GUI
* [PySimpleGUI](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI) for GUI building in python. 
* [SimpleGUIBuilder](https://github.com/PriestTheBeast/SimpleGUIBuilder): A GUI for creating/designing GUI's layouts for  [PySimpleGUI](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI)

## (Mega) Tutorials 
* [Building a SaaS App with Flask and Docker](http://buildasaasappwithflask.com/)
 
  A multi-part tutorial/course for building a SaaS (from scratch) using Flask and Docker. This course goes into detail about code, architecture, and libraries used during the course. The tutorial also provides enough information to have Docker up and running in local development setup. 
  This course is similar to [The Flask Megatutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) by Miguel Grinberg. 
* [The Flask Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) [Github](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/microblog): A multi-part tutorial series offering in-depth understanding of `Flask` framework and how to create web applications using `Flask`. The author also covers application deployment solutions.
* [Python hotexamples](https://python.hotexamples.com/) extracts examples from opensource projects about Python modules. 

## Static analysis
* [Exhaustive checking with `mypy`](https://hakibenita.com/python-mypy-exhaustive-checking) explains how to catch unhandled branches at compile time using `mypy`.
  
## Dependency injection 

* [Dependency injector](https://pypi.org/project/dependency-injector/) framework for Python.

### Python imports

[Don't run code at import time](https://www.benkuhn.net/importtime/) describes how modules are executed in Python at import time and what kind of issues it can raise.

## CLI 
* [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/) is a library to develop CLI applications with Python.
  
  Typer can be used to build CLI applications with support for type-hinting. This library is based on [click]() and is developed by [Sebastián Ramírez
](https://tiangolo.com/), the creator of [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).


## Concurrency, Multithreading, and Multiprocessing
* [Python Sync vs Async](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/sync-vs-async-python-what-is-the-difference) gives an in-depth view of how `async` is implemented in Python and what are the different options to achieve concurrency in your Python programs. It also outlines the situations where `async` brings performance improvement compared to regular python code.
* [Concurrency in Python](https://realpython.com/python-concurrency/)
* [Async-io Python](https://realpython.com/async-io-python/)

## Testing 
* [pytest-split](https://github.com/jerry-git/pytest-split) split pytest suites into equally sized suites to run tests parallely. 

## Debugging
* [Pudb](https://pypi.org/project/pudb/) is a lightweight keyboard-friendly Python debugger, which enables to write and test code in a terminal. 

## General 
* [Colorma](https://github.com/tartley/colorama) print out colorized text on terminal.
* [Archivy](https://archivy.github.io/) allows to preserve personal notes and other content in searchable and extensible wiki.
* [Algorithms in Python](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/python) is a Github repo containing implementation of several algorithms in Python.
* [semver](https://pypi.org/project/semver/) for handling semantic versions in Python.
